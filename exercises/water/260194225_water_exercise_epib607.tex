water?}\label{what-percentage-of-the-worlds-surface-is-covered-by-water}

The data provided by the
\href{https://topex.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/get_srtm30.cgi}{Scripps Institution
of Oceanography} can provide an answer, but some work is required on
your part. James Hanley (JH) has randomly sampled \(n=5\) and \(n=20\)
latitudes and longitudes for every student in the class. This document
contains unique latitudes and longitudes for
