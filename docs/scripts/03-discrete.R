## Count the number of days in February which have zero precipitation.

## Count the number of goals in a football match.

## In both of these examples, we need a formula to specify each

## Measure the operating temperature of an experimental process.

## A random variable $X$ on $\Omega$ is a function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the set $\mathbb{R}$ of all real numbers denoted by

## Random variables are customarily denoted by uppercase letters, such as $X$ and $Y$, lowercase letters to represent

## Suppose a coin is tossed three times. Let $X$ be the number of heads observed. The sample space is

## Let the random variable $X: \left\lbrace \textrm{rain, snow, clear} \right\rbrace \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by

## For the case $\Omega = \left\lbrace \textrm{rain, snow, clear} \right\rbrace$, we might define a second random variable $Y$ by saying that $Y = 0$ if it rains, $Y = -1/2$ if it snows, and $Y = 7/8$ if it is clear. That is $Y(rain) = 0$, $Y(snow) = 1/2$, and $Y(rain) = 7/8$.

## If the sample space corresponds to flipping three different coins, then we could let $X$ be the total number of heads showing, let $Y$ be the total number of tails showing, let $Z = 0$ if there is exactly one head, and otherwise $Z = 17$.

## As a special case, every constant value $c$ is also a random variable, by saying that $c(s) = c$ for all $s \in \Omega$. Thus, 5 is a random variable, as is 3 or âˆ’21.6.

## If $A$ is any event, then we can define the indicator function of $A$, written $I_A$, to be the random variable
