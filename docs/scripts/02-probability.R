## The sample space $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment. Points $\omega$ in $\Omega$ are called sample outcomes, realizations, or elements.

## $\Omega = \left\lbrace  H, T  \right\rbrace$

## $\Omega = \left\lbrace  1,2,3,4,5,6  \right\rbrace$

## $\Omega = \left\lbrace  x : 0 \leq x \leq 1  \right\rbrace$

## $\Omega = \left\lbrace  x :  x > 0  \right\rbrace = {\mathbb{R}}^{+}$

## $\Omega = \left\{ x:a\leq x\leq b\right\} \subseteq { \mathbb{R}}$

## The experiment may involve the observation of a nucleotide or protein sequence, so that the sample space $\Omega$ may comprise all sequences (of bases/amino acids) up to a given length, and a sample outcome would be a particular observed sequence.

## An event $E$ is a subset of the sample space $\Omega$ ($E \subseteq \Omega$). Events are usually denoted by upper case letters near the beginning of the alphabet, like $A, B, C$. An event which consists of only one outcome is called a simple (or elementary event); otherwise it is a compound event.

## The sets $\Omega$ and $E$ can be either be written as a list of items, for example,

## To ensure that the probability assignments will be consistent with our intuitive notions of probability, all assign-

## $P(\varnothing) = 0$ where $\varnothing$ is the null event. This in turn implies that the property contained in Axiom 3 is valid for a finite collection of events.

## For any event $A$,

## For any event $A$,

## For any events $A$ and $B$,

## If the first element or object of an ordered pair can be selected in $n_1$ ways, and for each of these $n_1$ ways the second element of the pair can be selected in $n_2$ ways, then the number of pairs is $n_1 \cdot n_2$.

## Any ordered sequence of $k$ objects taken from a set of $n$ distinct objects is called a permutation of size $k$ of the objects. The number of permutations of size $k$ that can be constructed from the $n$ objects is denoted by $P_k^n$:

## Given a set of $n$ distinct objects, any unordered subset of size $k$ of the objects is called a combination. The number of combinations $n$ of size $k$ that can be formed from $n$ distinct objects will be denoted by

## We flip three different fair coins, and

## Complex components are assembled in a plant that uses two different assembly lines, $A$ and $A^c$ . Line $A$ uses older equipment than $A^c$, so it is somewhat slower and less reliable. $B$ are the defective components and $B^c$ are the nondefective.

## Given two events $A$ and $B$, with $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to

## Suppose a balanced die is tossed in the next room. We are told that a number less than 4 was observed. What is the probability the number was either 1 or 2?

## Toss two balanced dice. Let $A$ = {sum of 5} and $B$ = {first die is $\leq$ 2}. Find $P(A|B)$

## Two balanced dice are tossed. What is the probability that the first die gives a number less than three, given that the sum is odd?

## Toss an unbalanced die with probs $P(1)=.1$, $P(2)=.1$, $P(3)=.3$, $P(4)=.2$, $P(5)=.1$, $P(6)=.2$. Let $A={\geq 5}$ and $B={\geq 2}$. Find $P(A|B)$.

## Two balanced coins were tossed, and it is known that at least one was a head. What is the probability that both were heads?

## Two cards are drawn without replacement from a standard deck. Find the probability that

## The numbers 1 to 5 are written on five slips of paper and placed in a hat. Two slips are drawn at random without replacement. What is the probability that the first number is 3, given a sum of seven?

## A card is selected at random (i.e. every card has the same probability of being chosen) from a deck of 52. What is the probability it is a red card or a face card?

## \[P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)\]

## A tank has three red fish and two blue fish. Two fish are chosen at random and without replacement. What is the probability of getting

## Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$ be mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Then for any other event $B$,

## Suppose a class contains 60% girls and 40% boys. Suppose that 30% of the girls have long hair, and 20% of the boys have long hair. A student is chosen uniformly at random from the class. What is the probability that the chosen student will have long hair?

## Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be a collection of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events with $P(A_i) > 0$ for $i=1, \ldots, k$. Then for any other event B, for which $P(B)>0$, we have

## Suppose urn #1 has 3 red and 2 blue balls, and urn #2 has 4 red and 7 blue balls. Suppose one of the two urns is selected with probability $1/2$ each, and then one of the balls within that urn is picked uniformly at random.

## There are three Canadian firms which build large bridges, firm 1, firm 2, and firm 3. 20% of Canadian large bridges have been built by firm 1, 30% by firm 2, and the rest by firm 3. 5% of the bridges built by firm 1 have collapsed, while 10% of those by firm 2 have collapsed, and 30% by firm 3 have collapsed.

## Toss a fair coin 10 times. Let $A = {\textrm{at least one head}}$. Let $T_j$ be the event that tails occurs on the $j^{th}$ toss. Find $P(A)$

## In Example \@ref(exm:unbalanced), if $A$ is the event that the die was 5, and $B$ is the event that the coin was tails, then calculate $P(A), P(B)$ and $P(A\cap B)$
