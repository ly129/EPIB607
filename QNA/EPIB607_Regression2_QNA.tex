\section{Is there a difference between $\hat{y}$ and $\bar{y}$?}

I refer to $\hat{y}_i$ as the predicted value from the fitted regression model for the $i$th observation. $\bar{y}$ is the sample mean. 

\section{A list of all notations and what they represent?}



\section{What is the parameter we are trying to find in the ratio linear regression?}


\section{Why are there t-statistics and F-statistics given as outputs of a regression model? Why are we analyzing t if the F is what is usually reported for regression models?}



\section{Kind of confused about the overall goal of a regression... Is it just a faster way to get all the individual outputs (like the estimates, p-value, standard error, etc.), or does it have some extra use in and of itself?}




\section{Why is south estimate log(theta hat), why isnt it log(u) + log (theta)}


\section{Why is the df n-p and not n1+n2-1?}

\section{When calculating residual ($y_i - \hat{y}_i$), is $\hat{y}_i$ the sample mean for the entire sample, or the sample mean for North and for South? And if it's the latter, are you subtracting $\hat{y}_i$ for North from all the North $y$'s and $\hat{y}_i$ for South for all the South $y$'s, or subtracting both $\hat{y}_i$ for each $y$?}
