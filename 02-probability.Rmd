The random variation associated with ``measurement'' procedures in a
scientific analysis requires a framework in which the
\textbf{uncertainty} and \textbf{variability} that are inherent in
the procedure can be handled. The key goal of Probability and
Statistical modelling is to establish a mathematical framework
within which \textit{random} variation (due, for example, to
experimental error or natural variation) can be quantified so that
\textit{systematic }variation (arising due to potentially important
biological differences) can be studied.

Broadly, the ``\textit{Scientific Process}'' involves several different
stages:

\bigskip

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cl}
\text{{THEORETICAL MODELLING}} & \longrightarrow \text{{MATHEMATICAL}} \\
\downarrow & \text{\qquad \qquad {/PROBABILISTIC MODELLING}} \\
\text{{PREDICTION}} &  \\
\downarrow &  \\
\text{{EXPERIMENTATION/OBSERVATION}} &  \\
\downarrow &  \\
\text{{VALIDATION}} &
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

\bigskip

\textit{Mathematical/Probabilistic} \textit{modelling} facilitates
PREDICTION; \textit{Statistical Analysis }provides the means of validation
of predicted behaviour.

\bigskip

\bigskip

To explain the variation in observed data, we need to introduce the
concept of a \textit{probability distribution}. Essentially we need
to be able to model, or specify, or compute the ``chance'' of
observing the data that we collect or expect to collect. This will
then allow us to assess how likely the data were to occur by chance
alone, that is, how ``surprising'' the observed data are in light of
an assumed theoretical model.
\bigskip

\bigskip

For example, consider two nucleotide sequences of the same length that we
wish to assess for similarity:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{{Sequence 1}}{\qquad } & ATAGTAGATACGCACCGAGGA \\
&  \\
\text{{Sequence 2}}{\qquad } & ATCTTAGATAGGCACTGAGGA
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
How can we assess sequence similarity formally ? The number of
discordant positions is 4, but how informative is that summary
measure ? Perhaps we need to assess the chance, for example, that a
point mutation $A\rightarrow C $ occurs (as in the discordant
position 3).in unit evolutionary time. \ Perhaps the chance of
observing a sub-sequence
\begin{equation*}
ATCTTA
\end{equation*}
rather than
\begin{equation*}
ATAGTA
\end{equation*}
(in positions 1-6) in important. Is the hidden (or \textit{latent})
structure in the sequence, corresponding to whether the sequence
originates from a coding region or otherwise, important ? Can we
even infer the hidden structure in light of the data we have
observed ?

These questions can only really be answered when we have an
understanding of randomness and variation. The framework that we
will use to pose and answer such questions formally is given to us
by \textit{probability theory}.
