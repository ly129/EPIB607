% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically
through the DALITE website. Therefore \textbf{you do not need to hand
anything in}. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For
each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer
on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the
right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's
rationale. Recall that access to your assignments is managed through
tokens sent to your e-mail address. You will be sent a new link
everytime a new assignment has been posted.
