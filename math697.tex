The main learning outcomes of this course are to get a broad idea about
some frequently used probability models and to learn basic results and
techniques in probability theory and statistical inference. Most of the
materials for the course will be drawn from the first seven chapters of
the textbook. The book does not, however, contain all the materials we
intend to cover in this course. Some extra notes will therefore be given
on those topics not in the text book. We will also introduce
computational methods in statistics with the statistical software
program \texttt{R}.

\chapter[Overview and Descriptive Statistics]{\texorpdfstring{Overview
and Descriptive Statistics\footnote{Devore and Berk.}}{Overview and Descriptive Statistics}}\label{intro}

Statistical concepts and methods are not only useful but indeed often
indispensable in understanding the world around us. They provide ways of
gaining new insights into the behavior of many phenomena that you will
encounter in your chosen field of specialization.

The discipline of statistics teaches us how to make intelligent
judgments and informed decisions in the presence of \emph{uncertainty
and variation}.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
Without uncertainty or variation, there would be little need for
statistical methods or statisticians.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

If the yield of a crop were the same in every field, if all individuals
reacted the same way to a drug, if everyone gave the same response to an
opinion survey, and so on, then a \textbf{single observation would
reveal all desired information}.

\section{Populations and Samples}\label{populations-and-samples}

We are constantly exposed to collections of facts, or data, both in our
professional capacities and in everyday activities. The discipline of
statistics provides methods for organizing and summarizing data and for
drawing conclusions based on information contained in the data.

An investigation will typically focus on a well-defined collection of
objects constituting a population of interest: - In one study, the
population might consist of all gelatin capsules of a particular type
produced during a specified period. - Another investigation might
involve the population consisting of all individuals who received a B.S.
in mathematics during the most recent academic year.

When desired information is available for all objects in the population,
we have what is called a census. Constraints on time, money, and other
scarce resources usually make a census impractical or infeasible.
Instead, a subset of the population, \textbf{a sample}, is selected in
some prescribed manner. Thus we might obtain a sample of pills from a
particular production run as a basis for investigating whether pills are
conforming to manufacturing specifications, or we might select a sample
of last year's graduates to obtain feedback about the quality of the
curriculum.

\subsection{Variable}\label{variable}

We are usually interested only in certain characteristics of the objects
in a population: the amount of vitamin C in the pill, the gender of a
mathematics graduate, the age at which the individual graduated, and so
on. A variable is any characteristic whose value may change from one
object to another in the population. Can be categorical (male/female) or
numerical (temperature).

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
\hline
data type & description\\
\hline
univariate & consists of observations on a single variable\\
\hline
bivariate & observations are made on each of two variables\\
\hline
multivariate & more than two variables\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Branches of Statistics}\label{branches-of-statistics}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Descriptive Statistics}: summarize and describe important
  features of the data. Can be graphs (histograms, boxplots, and scatter
  plots), or numeric summaries (mean, standard deviations, and
  correlation coefficients)
\item
  \textbf{Inferential Statistics}: Techniques for generalizing from a
  sample to a population. Having obtained a sample from a population, an
  investigator would frequently like to use sample information to draw
  some type of conclusion (make an inference of some sort) about the
  population. That is, the sample is a means to an end rather than an
  end in itself.
\end{itemize}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
The focus of this couse is Inferential statistics. But to get there we
need to understand the basic concepts of probability
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

The relationship between the two disciplines can be summarized by saying
that probability reasons from the population to the sample
(\textbf{deductive reasoning}), whereas inferential statistics reasons
from the sample to the population (\textbf{inductive reasoning}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/probstat.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Before we can understand what a particular sample can tell us about the
population, we should first understand the uncertainty associated with
taking a sample from a given population. This is why we study
probability before statistics.

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[Use of manual lap belts in cars equipped with automatic shoulder belt systems]
\protect\hypertarget{ex:unnamed-chunk-6}{}{\label{ex:unnamed-chunk-6}
\iffalse (Use of manual lap belts in cars equipped with automatic
shoulder belt systems) \fi{} }\emph{Probability}: assume that 50\% of
all drivers in a certain metropolitan area regularly use their lap belt
\(\rightarrow\) an assumption about the population. We might ask - How
likely is it that a sample of 100 such drivers will include at least 70
who regularly use their lap belt? - How many of the drivers in a sample
of size 100 can we expect to regularly use their lap belt?

\emph{Inference}: a sample of 100 drivers of such cars revealed that 65
regularly use their lap belt. We might ask\\
- Does this provide substantial evidence for concluding that more than
50\% of all such drivers in this area regularly use their lap belt We
are attempting to use sample information to answer a question about the
structure of the entire population from which the sample was selected.

\section[Introduction]{\texorpdfstring{Introduction\footnote{Reproduced
  with permission from \url{http://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/}}}{Introduction}}\label{introduction1}

The random variation associated with \emph{measurement} procedures in a
scientific analysis requires a framework in which the
\textbf{uncertainty} and \textbf{variability} that are inherent in the
procedure can be handled. The key goal of Probability and Statistical
modelling is to establish a mathematical framework within which
\emph{random} variation (due, for example, to experimental error or
natural variation) can be quantified so that \emph{systematic} variation
(arising due to potentially important biological differences) can be
studied.

Broadly, the \textit{Scientific Process} involves several different
stages:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cl}
\text{{THEORETICAL MODELLING}} & \rightarrow \text{{MATHEMATICAL/PROBABILISTIC MODELLING}} \\
\downarrow &  \\
\text{{PREDICTION}} &  \\
\downarrow &  \\
\text{{EXPERIMENTATION/OBSERVATION}} &  \\
\downarrow &  \\
\text{{VALIDATION}} &

\emph{Mathematical/Probabilistic} \emph{modelling} facilitates
PREDICTION; \emph{Statistical Analysis} provides the means of validation
of predicted behaviour.

To explain the variation in observed data, we need to introduce the
concept of a \emph{probability distribution}. Essentially we need to be
able to model, or specify, or compute the \emph{chance} of observing the
data that we collect or expect to collect. This will then allow us to
assess how likely the data were to occur by chance alone, that is, how
\emph{surprising} the observed data are in light of an assumed
theoretical model.

For example, consider two nucleotide sequences of the same length that
we wish to assess for similarity:

\BeginKnitrBlock{example}[Two nucleotide sequences]
\protect\hypertarget{ex:unnamed-chunk-7}{}{\label{ex:unnamed-chunk-7}
\iffalse (Two nucleotide sequences) \fi{} }

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{{Sequence 1}}{\qquad } & ATAGTAGATACGCACCGAGGA \\
&  \\
\text{{Sequence 2}}{\qquad } & ATCTTAGATAGGCACTGAGGA
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

How can we assess sequence similarity formally ? The number of
discordant positions is 4, but how informative is that summary measure ?
Perhaps we need to assess the chance, for example, that a point mutation
\[ A\rightarrow C \] occurs (as in the discordant position 3) in unit
evolutionary time. Perhaps the chance of observing a sub-sequence

\begin{equation*}
ATCTTA
\end{equation*}

rather than

\begin{equation*}
ATAGTA
\end{equation*}

(in positions 1-6) is important.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the hidden (or \emph{latent}) structure in the sequence,
  corresponding to whether the sequence originates from a coding region
  or otherwise, important ?
\item
  Can we even infer the hidden structure in light of the data we have
  observed ?\\
\end{itemize}
\EndKnitrBlock{example}

These questions can only really be answered when we have an
understanding of randomness and variation. The framework that we will
use to pose and answer such questions formally is given to us by
\emph{probability theory}.

Often in life we are confronted by our own ignorance. Whether we are
pondering tonight's traffic jam, tomorrow's weather, next week's stock
prices, an upcoming election, or where we left our hat, often we do not
know an outcome with certainty. Instead, we are forced to guess, to
estimate, to hedge our bets.

\begin{quote}
Probability is the science of uncertainty.
\end{quote}

It provides precise mathematical rules for understanding and analyzing
our own ignorance. It does not tell us tomorrow's weather or next week's
stock prices; rather, it gives us a \textbf{framework for working with
our limited knowledge} and for \textbf{making sensible decisions based
on what we do and do not know}.

To say there is a 40\% chance of rain tomorrow is not to know tomorrow's
weather. Rather, it is to \textbf{know what we do not know} about
tomorrow's weather. In this course, we will develop a more precise
understanding of what it means to say there is a 40\% chance of rain
tomorrow. We will learn how to work with ideas of randomness,
probability, expected value, prediction, estimation, etc., in ways that
are sensible and mathematically clear.
