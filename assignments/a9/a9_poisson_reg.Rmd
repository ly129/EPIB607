  In this assignment you will practice Poisson regression. Be sure to state the regression model in terms of parameters first. Use regression functions to fit these models. Answers should be given in full sentences (DO NOT just provide the number). All figures should have appropriately labeled axes, titles and captions (if necessary). Units for means and CIs should be provided. All graphs and calculations are to be completed in an R Markdown document. Please submit both the compiled HTML report and the source file (.Rmd) to myCourses by November 23, 2018, 11:59pm. Both HTML and .Rmd files should be saved as 'IDnumber_LastName_FirstName_EPIB607_A9'.

# Template {-}

There is no template for this assignment. You may use the same template from previous assignments. Be sure to include your code at the end of the compiled report.

library(knitr)

# Bednets

See the 2018 Lancet article \textit{Efficacy of Olyset Duo, a bednet containing pyriproxyfen and permethrin, versus a permethrin-only net against clinical malaria in an area with highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors in rural Burkina Faso: a cluster-randomised controlled trial} (\texttt{Bednets.pdf} in \texttt{A9} folder of myCourses) by Tiono et. al. 

a. Reproduce the Rate ratio and 95\% CI in Table 2. Start by writing down the model in terms of a regression equation with parameters and determinants. Interpret the rate ratio. 
b. Perform a goodness of fit test for the model in part (a). Is this a good fit? If not, \underline{explain} what you might do to improve the fit. 
c. Calculate the rate difference and 95\% CI comparing PPF-treated to Standard long-lasting insecticidal nets. 


# Population mortality rates in Denmark

The following table contains mortality data for males and females in Denmark for 4 age groups over three time periods.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

pt <- read.table("~/git_repositories/epib607/slides/regression/handouts/denmark_person_time.txt", skip = 1, header = TRUE)
pt$type <- "PT"
deaths <- read.table("~/git_repositories/epib607/slides/regression/handouts/denmark_deaths.txt", skip = 1, 
header = TRUE)
deaths$type <- "deaths"
df <- rbind(pt, deaths)

tt <- df %>% 
gather(key = "group", value = "value", -Year, -Age, -type) %>% 
spread(type, value) %>% 
mutate(rate = deaths / PT) %>% 
gather(key = "measure", value = "value", -Year, -Age, -group) %>% 
unite(col = "measure", group, measure) %>% 
spread(measure, value) 


# head(tt)
# str(tt)
# levels(tt$Year)
# levels(tt$Age)
knitr::kable(tt[which(tt$Year %in% c("1980-1984","2000-2004", "2005-2009") & 
tt$Age %in% c("70-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85-89")),c("Year", "Age", "Female_deaths", "Female_PT", "Female_rate", 
"Male_deaths", "Male_PT", "Male_rate")], row.names = FALSE)
```

a. Come up with a suitable regression model for this data. Write down the regression equation in terms of parameters and determinants. 
b. Estimate the parameters of this model using the data in the table above. Provide the fitted regression equation. 
c. Interpret the parameter for gender. Are mortality rates significantly different in males compared with females?
d. Perform a goodness of fit test for the fitted model in part (b). Is this a good fit?
