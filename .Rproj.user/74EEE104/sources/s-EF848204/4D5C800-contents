**b. We are interested in knowing if obese children receiving food counseling gain less weight over a 15-week period. State the regression model as a function of population parameters. Be sure to define what each parameter represents.** **(10 Points)**


<span style="color:red">(5 Points) for the regression model</span> 

$\mu = \mu_0 + \Delta\mu*\textrm{Intervention}$ 

where

\[
\textrm{Intervention} = \begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{intervention group} \\
0 & \textrm{control group} \\
\end{cases}
\]

<span style="color:red">(5 Points) for defining each parameter</span> 

$\mu$: The mean weight change over the 15 week period for the population in pounds. 

$\mu_0$: The intercept; the mean weight change for the control group (When X = 0) in pounds.

$\Delta\mu$: The slope term; the population difference in mean weight change between control group and intervention group. 

**c. Use a regression procedure to answer this question. State the hypotheses, interpret the parameter of interest and a brief statement about your findings. (20 Points)** 

<span style="color:red">(5 Points) for hypotheses</span>

$H_0: \mu_C = \mu_I$ The mean weight gain in control group equal to the mean weight gain in intervention group over the 15 week period. 

$H_A: \mu_C \neq \mu_I$ The mean weight gain in control group is different from the mean weight gain in intervention group over the 15 week period.

obeselm <- lm(Weight ~ Intervention, data = obese) # (5 Points)

```


<span style="color:red"> (5 Points) for Interpretation of parameters: </span>

$\hat\mu_0$: The estimated mean weight change of obese children assigned to the control group after 15 weeks is `r round(sumobe$coefficient[1],3)` lb. 

$\hat\Delta\mu$: The estimated difference in mean weight change of obese children assigned to the intervention group compared to the control group is `r round(sumobe$coefficient[2],3)` lb. 

<span style="color:red"> (5 Points) for the conclusion/ statement : </span>
```{r, echo=TRUE}
coef(sumobe)[2] + qnorm(c(0.025, 0.975)) * sqrt(vcov(sumobe)[2,2])
```

The estimated difference in mean weight change of obese children assigned to intervention group compared to the control group is `r round(sumobe$coefficient[2],3)` lb, 95% CI: [-8.32, -3.44] lb, with a p-value < 0.05. Because the p-value is lower than critical p-value and 95% CI does not capture zero in it, I conclude that the expected mean weight gain for control group is significantly different from the expected mean weight gain for the intervention group and reject the null hypothesis that $H_0: \mu_C = \mu_I$ in favor of $H_A$.  

**d. Show how the Std. Error was calculated for the parameter of interest. (5 Points)**

SE for $\Delta\mu$: $SE_{\Delta\mu} = \sqrt{\frac{(N_{c} - 1)s_{c}^2 + (N_{I} - 1)s_{I}^2}{N_{c} + N_{I} - 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{c}} + \frac{1}{N_{I}}}$  


```{r, echo=TRUE}
Control <- obese[which(obese$Intervention == 0),]
Intervention <- obese[which(obese$Intervention == 1),]

SD_Control <- sd(Control$Weight)
SD_Intervention <- sd(Intervention$Weight)

N_Control <- nrow(Control)
N_Intervention <- nrow(Intervention)

SEM <- round(sqrt(((N_Control - 1)*(SD_Control^2) + (N_Intervention - 1)*(SD_Intervention^2))/(N_Control + N_Intervention - 2)) * sqrt(1/N_Control + 1/N_Intervention),3)

```

$N_{c}$ = `r N_Control`

$N_{I}$ = `r N_Intervention`

$s_{c}$ = `r round(SD_Control,3)`

$s_{0}$ = `r round(SD_Intervention,3)`

$SE_{\hat\Delta\mu} = \sqrt{\frac{(53 - 1)*5.24^2 + (23 - 1)*4.31^2}{53 + 23 - 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{53} + \frac{1}{23}}$ 

$SE_{\hat\Delta\mu}$ = `r SEM`. 
Std.Error from regression is the same as $SE_{\hat\Delta\mu}$ above and was calculated as indicated above.

# Student drinking (20 Points)
**a. Do a complete analysis that reports on a comparison of the drinking behavior of women and men. (15 Points)**

```

<span style="color:red"> (2 Points) for the hypotheses: </span>

$H_0: \mu_f = \mu_m$ The population mean number of drinks consumed by female students per session is equal to the mean number of drinks consumed by male students per session.  

$H_A: \mu_f \neq \mu_m$ The population mean number of drinks consumed by female students per session is different from the mean number of drinks consumed by male students per session. 

<span style="color:red">(5 Points) for the regression model: </span>

$\mu = \mu_0 + \Delta\mu*Male$

where $\mu$ is the population mean number of drinks, $\mu_0$ is the population mean number of drinks for females and $\Delta\mu$ is the population mean difference in the number of drinks between males and females and 

\[
\textrm{Male} = \begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{male} \\
0 & \textrm{female} \\
\end{cases}
\]

```

<span style="color:red">(4 Points) for the interpretation of parameters: </span>

$\hat\mu_0$: The estimated mean number of drinks for female students per session is 4.29.

$\hat\Delta\mu$: The estimated difference in mean number of drinks between female and male students per session is 2.22 [1.40, 3.04]. 

**b. Summarise your findings in a 140 character tweet. (5 Points)**

A new study finds a significant difference between male and female drinking behavior among sophomore students! Male students have around 2 to 3 more drinks compared to females. 

**c. Verify the constant variance assumption of your model.(BONUS 5 Points)**

<span style="color:red"> (1 Points) for the method used to get to the conclusion - R Code </span>

```{r}
pacman::p_load(car)
car::ncvTest(drinklm)
car::leveneTest(Drinks~as.factor(Male), data = drink)
stats::bartlett.test(Drinks~as.factor(Male), data = drink)
```
<span style="color:red"> (4 Points) for Explanation: </span>

Any of the three equality of variance tests (non-constant variance score test, Levene, and Bartlett) have p-values less than critical p-value 0.05. This leads us to reject the null hypothesis that was tested here which states that the variance in the number of drinks is equal for males and females.

# Ink toxicity (40 Points)

```

**a. Verify that the two experimental groups are not significantly different at the beginning of the study (10 Points)**

<span style="color:red">(2 Points)  Hypotheses: </span>

$H_0: \mu_0 = \mu_1$ The mean body weight of female rats in the control group is equal to the mean body weight of female rats in the treatment group at the begining of the study.  

$H_A: \mu_0 \neq \mu_1$ The mean body weight of female rats in the control group is not equal to the mean body weight of female rats in the treatment group at the begining of the study. 

<span style="color:red">  (2 Points) for the regression model: </span>

**$\mu = \mu_0 + \Delta\mu*Treatment$**

where $\mu$ is the population mean weight of rats at the start of the study, $\mu_0$ is the population mean weight of the control rat at the start of the study, $\Delta \mu$ is how much more (or less) the treatment (ie: ink) rats weigh at the start of the study compared to the control rats, and $Treatment$ is the dummy variable where when a rat is given the ink, Treatment = 1 and when control Treatment = 0. 

<span style="color:red"> (2 Points) for the method of testing (Regression (Or t.test) </span>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
Inkbeforelm <- lm(Week0 ~ Treatment, data = Ink)
summary(Inkbeforelm)
coef(Inkbeforelm)[2] + qt(c(0.025, 0.975), df = nrow(Ink) - 1) * sqrt(vcov(Inkbeforelm)[2,2])
```

<span style="color:red">(4 Points)  Conclusion with evidence: </span>

The expected mean difference in body weight of female rats between the control and treatment groups at the begging of the study is 0.020 [-4.08, 4.12] grams with a p-value of 0.992. Therefore, the two experimental groups are not significantly different at the beginning of the study.

**b. Is there good evidence that ink application impairs growth in female rats between 7 and 20 weeks of age? State your answer in terms of the % difference between the mean weight gains of the two populations. Provide a 95% confidence interval for the % difference between the mean weight gains of the two populations.(20 Points)** 

<span style="color:red">  (4 Points) Hypotheses: </span>

The parameter of interest is $\theta = \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0}$, i.e., the ratio of mean weight gain of rats in the treatment group ($\mu_1$) compared to the control group ($\mu_0$).

$H_0: \theta = 1$ The ratio between the mean body weight gain of female rats in the treatment and control groups is equal to 1.

$H_A: \theta \neq 1$ The ratio between the mean body weight gain of female rats in the treatment and control groups is not equal to 1. 

**OR**

$H_0: \% Difference = 0$ The \% difference between the mean weigh gains of the treatment and control groups is equal to zero. 

$H_A: \% Difference \neq 0$ The \% difference between the mean weigh gains of the treatment and control groups is not equal to zero.

<span style="color:red"> (4 Points) for the regression model: </span> 

The regression model is: 

\[\mu = \mu_0 * \theta^{\textrm{Treatment}}\]

Since we cannot fit this model using a regression routine, we take the log of both sides:

\[\log(\mu) = \log(\mu_0) + log(\theta)\cdot \textrm{Treatment}\]

<span style="color:red"> (8 Points) for the method of testing (Regression) </span>

```{r, echo=TRUE}
Ink$Diff <- Ink$Week13 - Ink$Week0 
Inkafterglm <- glm(Diff~Treatment, data = Ink, family = gaussian(link = "log")) # (4 Points)
summaryInk <- summary(Inkafterglm)
summaryInk

theta <- exp(coef(summaryInk)[2])
Diff <- (theta - 1)*100 

#95%CIscoef (4 Points)
CIs_log_theta <- coef(summaryInk)[2] + qt(p = c(0.025, 0.975), df = nrow(Ink)-2) *  sqrt(vcov(summaryInk)[2,2])

CIs_theta <- exp(CIs_log_theta)
CIs_Diff <- (CIs_theta - 1)*100

#OR

coeff <- exp(confint(Inkafterglm))
CIs_con_theta <- c(coeff[2],coeff[4])
CIs_con_Diff <- (CIs_con_theta - 1)*100

```

$\theta = \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0}$


$\% Difference  = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0}{\mu_0}= \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0} - \frac{\mu_0}{\mu_0}= \frac{\mu_1}{\mu_0} - 1= \theta - 1$


$\log\theta = Estimate = -0.144$


$\theta = 0.866$


$\% Difference  = (0.866 - 1)*100\%$ 


$\% Difference  =$ `r Diff`


<span style="color:red"> (4 Points) Conclusion: </span>

The \% difference in the mean weight gain between the treatment group and the control group is -13.4%. The 95% CIs for the \% difference in mean weight gain is [-20.2, -6.11]%. The 95% CIs do not capture zero and therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean weight gain between control and treatment group. 

**c. Show how the p-value in the glm output was calculated for the parameter of interest. (10 Points)**
```{r}
point_estimate <- round(summaryInk$coefficients[2],5) 
SE <- round(summaryInk$coefficients[4],5)
df <- summaryInk$df.residual  
t_statistic <- round(((point_estimate - 0) / SE),3)
p_value <- round((pt(q = t_statistic, df = df) * 2),5)

```
 
P-value for $\log\hat{\theta}$:

i) Point estimate for $\log\hat{\theta} =$ `r (point_estimate)`   
ii) SE for $\log\hat{\theta}$: $SE_{\log\hat{\theta}} =$ `r SE`  
iii) degree of freedom: $df = n_1 + n_0 - 2 = 10 + 10 -2 = 18$  
iv) 2-sided t statistic: $t = \frac{\log\hat{\theta} - 0}{SE_{\log\hat{\theta}}} = \frac{{-0.144} - 0}{0.041}=$ `r round(t_statistic,3)`;  
v) p-value for $\log\hat\theta$: $p = Pr(>|t|) = pt(q = -3.479, df = 18) * 2 =$ `r round(p_value,8)`.
