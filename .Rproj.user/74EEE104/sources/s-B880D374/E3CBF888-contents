# A researcher who wished to test the difference of two (independent) y-bars with reported SEMs, SE0 and SE1 ,  did so by computing which test statistic?


a. (ybar1 - ybar0)  / (SE1 + SE0)
b. (ybar1 - ybar0)  / (SE1 - SE0)
c. **(ybar1 - ybar0)  / sqrt( (SE1)2 + (SE0)2 ) (Correct)**
d. (ybar1 - ybar0)  / sqrt( (SE1)2 - (SE0)2 )

# Which distribution is closer to Normal ?


a. Body weights of (unrelated) male air passengers
b. Body weights of  (unrelated) female air passengers
c. **Sum of weights of a (random male, random female) pair (Correct)**
d. **Difference of weights of a (random male, random  female) pair (Correct)**


## Correct rationales



## Incorrect rationales






# Refer to the Table on "Postoperative Effect on Plasma Ascorbic Acid for 105 Cases; Readings on the Same Individuals". You would get contradictory answers if you tested the differences in the means using i. the SE's in columns 1 and 2, and ii. the SE in column 3. TRUE or FALSE? Explain why in your rationale and say which one is correct.

a. **TRUE (Correct)**
b. FALSE

## Correct rationales



## Incorrect rationales

# How many calories does a fruit juice popsicle labeled "no sugar added" pack? A random sample of 10 popsicles of a particular brand is selected, and the calories per serving are measured. To get a confidence interval for the mean calories per serving of all no-sugar-added popsicles from this brand, you would use


a. **the one-sample t interval (Correct)**
b. the matched pairs t interval
c. the two sample t interval
d. the one sample z interval

## Correct rationales



## Incorrect rationales

# A  study is designed to compare the amount of vitamin C (in milligrams per serving) in oranges that reach the stores either 1 day after being picked or 3 days after being picked. A random sample of 15 oranges is taken for each group. To test whether there is a difference in the mean vitamin C amount of all oranges reaching stores either 1 day or 3 days after being picked, you would use


a. the one-sample t test
b. the one-sample z test
c. the one-sample t interval
d. the matched pairs t test
e. **the two-sample t test (Correct)**

## Correct rationales



## Incorrect rationales

# There are two common methods for measuring the concentration of a pollutant in fish tissue. Do the results of the two methods differ on the average? You apply both methods to one sample of 18 carp and use


a. **the one-sample t test (Correct)**
b. the one-sample z test
c. **the matched pairs t test (Correct)**
d. the two-sample t test
