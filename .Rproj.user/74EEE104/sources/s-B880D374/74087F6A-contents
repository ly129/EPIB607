# Cancers near Pickering nuclear station

The observed number of cases of leukemia was 18 in the Pickering nuclear station experience. We want to test if this observed number is compatible with the expected number of 12.8 cases, or whether it is greater than expected.

a. Calculate the standardized incidence ratio (SIR).
b. State the null and alternative hypotheses. Calculate the p-value for this test and provide a statement about the evidence.
c. Compute a 95\% CI for the SIR. Does your statement in part (b) agree with the 95\% CI?



# Self-reported percutaneous injuries in interns

Read [Section 6.3 of JH notes on rates](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b5q7vqo2ev6k2me/EPIB607intensity-model-inference-plan-2018.pdf?dl=0). Reproduce the CIs for the 3 P's (Pediatrics Psychiatry Pathology) in Table 1. Show your calculations. You may not use canned functions. 



# RCT of HPV vaccine

This question is based on Table 3 of the article [A Controlled trail of a Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Vaccine. Laura A. Koutsky et al., for The Proof of Principle Study Investigators.

*The per-protocol population included women who received the full regimen of study vaccine and who were seronegative for HPV-16 and negative for HPV-16 DNA on day 0 and negative for HPV-16
DNA at month 7 and in any biopsy specimens obtained between day 0 and month 7; who did not engage in sexual intercourse within 48 hours before the day 0 or month 7 visit; who did not receive any nonstudy vaccine within specified time limits relative to vaccination; who did not receive courses of certain oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents, immune globulin, or blood products; who were not enrolled in another study of an investigational agent; and who had a month 7 visit within the range considered acceptable for determining the month 7 HPV-16 status.

**The population includes women who received the full regimen of study vaccine and who were seronegative for HPV-16 and negative for HPV-16 DNA on day 0 and negative for HPV-16 DNA at month 7 and in any biopsy specimens obtained between day 0 and month 7.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.]

For the primary per-protocol efficacy analysis, calculate a 95\% CI to accompany the point estimates of infection rate (per 100 woman years) for both the HPV-16 vaccine and placebo groups. Show your calculations. You may not use canned functions. 


\item[b.] 

Based on your results in part (a), is there evidence to suggest that the HPV-16 vaccine reduced infection rates? Explain.

# Deaths by Horsekicks in the Prussian Army

This question is in reference to the Deaths by Horsekicks in the Prussian Army example presented in the [slides on one sample rates](https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/raw/master/slides/one_sample_rate/EPIB607_one_sample_rate.pdf). The following dataset gives the number of deaths by horsekicks, by year and army corps:

```{r, echo=c(1,3)}
horsekicks <- read.csv("horsekicks.csv")
horsekicks <- read.csv("~/git_repositories/epib607/assignments/a7/horsekicks.csv", sep = " ")
head(horsekicks)
# table(horsekicks$total)
# mean(horsekicks$total)
# var(horsekicks$total)
# stats::poisson.test(sum(horsekicks$total), diff(range(horsekicks$year)))
# qgamma(c(0.025, 0.975), shape = c(196, 197))/19
```


\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.] Create a table of observed and expected frequencies, like the one shown in the \href{https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/raw/master/slides/one_sample_rate/EPIB607_one_sample_rate.pdf}{slides on one sample rates}

\item[b.] Calculate a 95\% CI for the rate parameter.

\item[c.] (\textbf{BONUS}) Compute a goodness of fit statistic that measures the discrepancy between the observed and expected frequencies. Be sure to group the categories that have low expected values. Include in your answer, the sources you used to help you with this calculation. Write a sentence about your findings.
\end{enumerate}



# Crimes on full moon

This question is based on Tables I and II of the article: [Full moon and crime.Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) 1984; 289](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.289.6460.1789) (also available on myCourses). The incidence of crimes reported to three police stations in different towns (one rural, one urban, one industrial) was studied to see if it varied with the day of the lunar cycle. The period of the study covered 1978-1982.


\begin{enumerate}

\item[a.] Compare crime rates on FullMoon vs. NotFullMoon days (Table I) statistically by calculating a confidence interval for the daily rates in the two segments of time and seeing if they overlap. 

\item[b.] We don't recommend this way of testing differences; instead we recommend computing a single
CI for the rate difference or rate ratio. Following the example of the comparison of bone mineral losses (A4, Q3), compute a CI for the ratio and difference of daily rates by bootstrapping.


\end{enumerate}


<!--make a vector of length 183 containing 40 0s, 64 1;s ...  1 p 

make another of length 5295 containing 3102 0's, 1690 1's etc)

bootstrap each mean separately and subtract or form ratio

get 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles.

Also: test the fit of the observed frequencies in the all but fullMoon column of Table I
against the theoretical frequencies obtained using mu= 0.54
(ie fitted frequencies = 5109 x dpois(0:9, 0.54)

No need to do a formal chi-sq test... just visual.. but some may want to read more and figure out how to calculate a chi-sw. goodness of fit statistic.(most times it doesn't)

<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
