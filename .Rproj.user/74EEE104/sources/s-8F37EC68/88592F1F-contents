  The first step in understanding data is to hear what the data say, to "let the data speak for themselves". Numbers speak clearly only when we help them speak by organizing, displaying, and summarizing. In this assignment you will explore how to visualize your data and summarize it using summary statistics. All graphs and calculations are to be completed in an R Markdown document using the provided template. Please submit both the compiled HTML report and the source file (.Rmd) to myCourses by September 21, 2018, 11:59pm. Both HTML and .Rmd files should be saved as 'IDnumber_LastName_FirstName_EPIB607_A2'.

# Template {-}

The `.Rmd` template for Assignment 2 is available [here](sahirbhatnagar.com)


# The `mosaic` package (optional)

The `mosaic` package provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for descriptive statistics, plots and inference. You may find it useful to complete an interactive tutorial on its plotting functions. (note: this is optional and will not be counted for any marks). First install the following packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("learnr","mosaic"), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

Then, from RStudio, run the following command which will open a new page in your web broswer:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("introduction", 
                     package = "ggformula")
```

A more advanced tutorial on customizing your plots is available also:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("refining", 
                     package = "ggformula")
```



# Age-structures of Populations, then and now

The 1911 census of Ireland was taken on April 2nd 1911 and were released to the public in 1961. Follow [this link](http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/help/about19011911census.html) for further details on the census. James Hanley (JH) has scrapped the data and has provided you with a [three column .csv file]() which you can read into `R` using the following command:


1. Sign up for a free DataCamp account at [this link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/4c7d78a632b557dfdd6618b3e8fac09495571fec). Note: you are required to sign up with a `@mail.mcgill.ca` or `@mcgill.ca` email address.  
2. Sign in to [https://github.mcgill.ca/](https://github.mcgill.ca/) using your McGill email address and corresponding password.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.table("~/git_repositories/epib607/data/age_sex_frequencies_ireland.txt", header = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
dat <- dat %>% mutate(Male = case_when(Male == 1 ~ "Male", Male == 0 ~ "Female"))
colnames(dat) <- c("Gender", "Age", "Freq")
write.csv(dat, file = "data/age_sex_frequencies_ireland.csv", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)


library(rmarkdown)
draft("mypaper.Rmd", template="pdf", package="pinp", edit=TRUE)

```



# Install Git

You need to first install the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system on your system. Follow Chapter 1: Installing Git [at this link](https://plot.ly/r/github-getting-started-for-data-scientists/#chapter-1-installing-git) for step-by-step installation instructions with screenshots. 




# Install R and RStudio

This short course will guide you through installing both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). RStudio is a software application that facilitates how you interact with `R`. Click on the link the in the figure caption join the course.

\end{figure}


# Introduction to R

In this course you will get a hands-on introduction to the basic commands in R. With the knowledge gained in this course, you will be ready to perform a data analysis. Click on the link the in the figure caption join the course.

\end{figure}


# R Markdown

You will learn how to create reproducible reports using R and Markdown. All assignments for this course must be submitted in this format. Click on the link the in the figure caption join the course.

<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
