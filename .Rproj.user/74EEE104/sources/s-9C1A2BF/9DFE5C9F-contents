# Bias in step counters

Following the study by [Case et al., JAMA, 2015](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/Surveys/SmartphoneSteps.pdf), suppose we wished to assess, via a formal statistical test, whether (at an \textit{population}, rather than an individual, level)  a step-counting device or app is unbiased ($H_0$) or under-counts ($H_1$). Suppose we will do so the way [Case et al.](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/bios601/Surveys/SmartphoneSteps.pdf) did, but  measuring $n$ persons just once each. We observe the device count when the true count on the treadmill reaches 500. 

a. Using a planned sample size of $n=25$, and $\sigma = 60$ steps as a pre-study best-guess as to the  $s$ that might be observed in them, calculate the critical value at $\alpha = 0.01$.
b. Now imagine that the mean would not be the null 500, but $\mu=470.$ Calculate the probability that the mean in the sample of 25 will be less than this critical value. Use the same $s$ for the alternative that you used for the null. What is this probability called?
c. Determine the sample size required for 80\% power using a 1\% level of significance. Plot the null and alternative distributions in a diagram using the \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/master/assignments/a6/plot_null_alt.R}{\texttt{plot\_power}} function. An example of how to use this function and its output is shown below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=7}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/master/assignments/a6/plot_null_alt.R")

mu0 <- -0.540 # mean under the null
mha <- 0.99*-0.540 # mean under the alternative
s <- 0.0080 # sample/population SD
n <- 5 # sample size
cutoff <- mu0 + qnorm(0.95) * s / sqrt(n)

power_plot(n = n, 
           s = s,  
           mu0 = mu0, 
           mha = mha, 
           cutoff = cutoff,
           alternative = "greater",
           xlab = "Freezing point (degrees C)")

```



# Boosting sales

You want to see if a redesign of the cover of a mail-order catalog will increase sales. A very large number of customers will receive the original catalog and a random sample of customers will receive the one with the new cover. For planning purposes, you are willing to assume that the sales from the new catalog will be approximately normal with $\sigma=50$ dollars and that the mean for the original catalog will be $\mu = 25$ dollars. You decide to use a sample size of $n = 900$. You wish to test $$H_0: \mu = 25 \qquad H_a: \mu > 25$$You decide to reject $H_0$ if $\bar{y} > 26$ and fail to reject $H_0$ otherwise. 

a. Find the probability of a Type I error.
b. Find the probability of a Type II error when $\mu = 28$ dollars. 
c. Find the probability of a Type II error when $\mu = 30$ dollars. 
d. The distribution of sales is not normal because many customers buy nothing. Why is it nonetheless reasonable in this circumstance to assume that the mean will be approximately normal?

# Fill the bottles

Bottles of a popular cola drink are supposed to contain 300 milliliters (ml) of cola. There is some
variation from bottle to bottle because the filling machinery is not perfectly precise. Assume the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the filling process is 3 ml. An inspector, who suspects that the bottler is underfilling, measures the contents of a sample of six bottles. Power calculations help us see how large a shortfall in the bottle contents the test can be expected to detect.

a. Find the power of a 5% significance test against the alternative $\mu= 299$ ml.
b. Find the power against the alternative $\mu = 295$ ml.
c. Is the power against $\mu = 290$ higher or lower than the value you found in (b)? Explain why this result makes sense.
d. Make a plot of the power as a function of the shortfall ($\Delta$), and comment on the plot. 


# Drunken cyclists

In the United States approximately 900 people die in bicycle accidents each year. One study examined the records of 1711 bicyclists aged 15 or older who were fatally injured in bicycle accidents between 1987 and 1991 and were tested for alcohol. Of these, 542 tested positive for alcohol (blood alcohol concentration of 0.01% or higher).

a. To do statistical inference for these data, we think in terms of a model where $p$ is parameter that represents the probability that a tested bicycle rider is positive for alcohol. Find a 99% confidence interval for $p$.
b. Can you conclude from your analysis of this study that alcohol causes fatal bicycle accidents? Explain
c. In this study 386 bicyclists had blood alcohol levels above 0.10%, a level defining legally drunk in many states at the time. Give a 99% confidence interval for the proportion who were legally drunk according to this criterion.

# Handling contact lenses

Failure to follow recommended contact lens wear and care practices can lead to serious eye infection. A survey of a random sample of 281 Americans who wear contact lenses regularly asked about contact lens practices. The survey found that 139 respondents do not consistently wash their hands before handing their contact lenses. 

a. Obtain a plus four 99% confidence interval for the proportion $p$ of all American contact lens wearers who do not consistently wash their hands before handing their lenses. Verify that the conditions for your confidence interval are met.
b. Obtain a large sample 99% confidence interval for the proportion $p$ of all American contact lens wearers who do not consistently wash their hands before handing their lenses. How does this compare to the interval you calculated in part (a)? 
c. The researchers indicated that this survey had a substantial nonresponse rate. How does this information affect your interpretation of the confidence interval in context?
d. Survey participants simply answered a questionnaire, and no attempt was made to verify the answers. How does this information affect your interpretation of the confidence interval in context?


# Cancer-detecting dogs

A study was designed to determine whether dogs can be trained to identify urine specimens from individuals with bladder cancer. Dogs were first trained to discriminate between urine specimens from patients with bladder cancer and urine specimens from patients with other conditions. After the training was completed, the dogs had to pick one of seven new urine specimens. Each time, only one of the seven urine specimens came from a patient with bladder cancer. Out of 54 trials, the dogs identified the correct urine specimen 22 times. 

a. If the dogs were simply picking a urine specimen at random, we would expect them to be correct, on average, 1 out of 7 times. The experiment was designed to test whether dogs can perform better than chance. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test. 
b. Obtain the test statistic and the P-value. What do you conclude?

<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
