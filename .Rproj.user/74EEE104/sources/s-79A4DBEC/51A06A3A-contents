% If your first paragraph (i.e. with the \dropcap) contains a list environment (quote, quotation, theorem, definition, enumerate, itemize...), the line after the list may have some extra indentation. If this is the case, add \parshape=0 to the end of the list environment.


\section*{Marking}\label{marking}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Marking}

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically
through the DALITE website. Therefore \textbf{you do not need to hand
anything in}. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For
each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer
on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the
right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's
rationale.

\section{Boxplots}\label{boxplots}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Recognize that a basic numerical description of a distribution
  requires both a measure of center and a measure of spread.
\item
  Use the quartiles and the extremes to provide information about the
  unequal spread in the two sides of a skewed distribution.
\item
  Be able to calculate the quartiles and give the five-number summary of
  a data set of using a computer.
\item
  Understand that boxplots provide less detail than stemplots or
  histograms but are especially useful for comparing several
  distributions.

\section{Standard Deviation}\label{standard-deviation}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Know that the sample standard deviation, \(s\), is the measure of
  spread most commonly used when the mean, \(\bar{x}\), is used as the
  measure of center.
\item
  Know the formula for the standard deviation \(s\)
\item
  Know the basic properties of the standard deviation:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \(s \geq 0\), and only when all data values are identical can
  \(s = 0\)
\item
  \(s\) increases as the spread about \(x\) increases.
\item
  \(s\), like \(\bar{x}\), is strongly influenced by outliers.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Know that the standard deviation is most useful for symmetric
  distributions and, in particular, for normal distributions.
\item
  Know that adding the same constant \(a\) to all the observations
  increases the value of \(\bar{x}\) by \(a\). However, adding the same
  constant \(a\) to all the observations does not change the value of
  \(s\). That's because adding a constant \(a\) to all data values
  shifts the location of the data but does not affect its spread.
\item
  Know that multiplying all data values by a constant amount \(k\)
  changes \(\bar{x}\) and \(s\) by a factor of \(k\).
\end{enumerate}
