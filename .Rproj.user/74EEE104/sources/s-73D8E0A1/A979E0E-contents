```

**b) Create a suitable visualization of this data and then comment on any patterns you see and give reasons for these patterns. Your choice should leverage all the information provided in the data and be influeced by the message that you are trying to convey. Be sure to include an informative title and figure caption.**

```{r}

  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey91"))
```

Commentary: The shape of the population pyramid resembles that of stationary population. The population does not seem to be growing. Note the spikes in ages at milestones such as 30, 40, 50, and 60. This is likely due to rounding when the data was being filled out by the heads of the households on census night. 

**c) Calculate the mean age, the standard deviation (SD), and the quartiles: Q25, Q50 (median), Q75 separately for males and females.**

Here are the summary statistics for males:
```{r}
## Determining summary statistics for Males
Onlymales_c <- subset(cens, Gender == "Male" & Freq > 0)
Onlymales_c$Age_n <- Onlymales_c$Age + 0.5
freq_onlymales <- rep(Onlymales_c$Age_n,Onlymales_c$Freq)
summary(freq_onlymales)
```

Here is the standard deviation for males:
```{r}
## Determining standard deviation for males
sd(freq_onlymales)
```


Here are the summary statistics for females:
```{r}
## Determining summary statistics for Females
Onlyfemales_c <- subset(cens, Gender == "Female" & Freq > 0)
Onlyfemales_c$Age_n <- Onlyfemales_c$Age + 0.5
freq_onlyfemales <- rep(Onlyfemales_c$Age_n,Onlyfemales_c$Freq)
summary(freq_onlyfemales)
```

Here is the standard deviation for females:
```{r}
## Determining standard deviation females
sd(freq_onlyfemales)
```


**d) The orignial census cards have been scanned are available online. This one in particular is quite famous. Why?**

This census card is particularly famous because it contains the signature of William Gosset. William was a statistician working at the beer company Guinness when he revolutionized statistics. He is best-known for developing the "Student's t-distribution".

# Number of Authors

```{r}
## ---- Question-2 ------------------------------------------------------------

```
**a) Why report median number of subjects (instead of average)?**

In many cases, the median may be a better representation of the average data points rather than the mean, like when outliers are present, as the median is less sensitive to outliers.

**b) In 1976, can the standard deviation of 7.3 really be larger than the mean of 4.9? Explain. **

Yes, the standard deviation can be larger than the mean. When these situations arise, there are likely due to a number of outliers, sometimes extreme outliers, influencing the standard deviation more than the mean. 

**c) In light of (a) and (b), how would you present the data in this table?**

The authors likely chose to measure the average number of authors with the mean and standard deviation to highlight the outliers present in 1976, as this could draw attention to the new trend of more authors names being on published articles. A visual representation that may appropriately convey this information to reader is to produce two different line graphs.  On the x-axis of both graphs, I would present the "Year" variable. On the y axis of one of the graphs, I would present numbers from 10-160, which could indicate the measurements of number of articles studied and the median number of subjects. On the other graph, the y-axis scale would indicate the measurements of mean number of authors and standard deviations of number of authors, and the scale would range from 1-10. These graphs would be side by side. The reason they would have separate y-axis is because of how different the values are in terms of magnitude and trying to use two different y-axis on the same graph can be misleading. These two line graphs would visually show that there is a recent increase in authors' names on publications, despite the other three factors remaining the same.

# Cancer Deaths in the US

```{r}
## ---- Question-3 ------------------------------------------------------------

```

**a) In the figure Trends in Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates by Site, Males, US, 1930-2014 (PDF) list the scales being used and the variable that has been mapped onto them.**

Scales = x-axis, y-axis, and line colour. 

Variables = year, rate per 100,000 male population, cancer type

x-axis = year,
y-axis = rate per 100,000 male population,
line colour = cancer type

**b) Briefly comment on what you like about the figure, and what could have been improved (e.g. aesthetics, labels, use of color).**

I like how there is a line connecting cancer type and its corresponding line in the figure. I find this more visually pleasing than if a legend was chosen instead, due to the similarity between some of the colours. If I had to change one thing, it would be the selection of colours for the lines. Some of the chosen colours are different shades of blue. Perhaps a different colour scheme that differentiates the lines better could be chosen, like scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1"). 

**c) Plot the data using a graph of your choice with the goal of comparing males vs. females. (you might consider using the function gf_line from the ggformula package). Briefly comment on your comparison. Be sure to include an informative title and figure caption.**

```{r}

males <- readxl::read_xlsx("~/Downloads/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-males-1930-2014.xlsx",
                           skip = 1, n_max = 85) %>% mutate(Gender = "Male")
females <- readxl::read_xlsx("~/Downloads/age-adjusted-cancer-death-rates-females-1930-2014.xlsx",
                             skip = 1, n_max = 85) %>% mutate(Gender = "Female")
cancer_rates <- dplyr::bind_rows(list(females,males))

cancer_rates_melt <- tidyr::gather(cancer_rates, key = "Site", value = "Rate", -Year, -Gender)

ggplot(cancer_rates_melt, aes(x = Year, y = Rate, color = Site)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Gender) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  ggtitle("Trends in United States Cancer Deaths Between 1930-2014") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  labs(caption = "Figure 2. Shown is the trends of deaths due to cancer by gender between 1930-2014.

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1930,2014),
                     breaks = seq(1930,2010,20),labels = (seq(1930,2010,20))) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),limits = c(0,100),
                     breaks = seq(0,100,20),labels = (seq(0,100,20))) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey91"))
```

Shown were two line graphs with females and males side-by-side. This way, a visual comparison could be made between genders. 

Some similarities between the genders include lung/bronchus cancer emerging as the predominant cancer causing deaths, and how liver cancers are on the rise for both genders. 

Some differences include some cancers effecting one gender solely due to the physical make-up of each gender (only males have prostate cancer, only woman have uterus cancer), pancreatic cancer seems to be rising for men and not women, and leukemia data appears to be missing for females. 

# Does breast-feeding weaken bones?

**A negative value of mineral_loss indicates a loss in mineral content. Do the data show distinctly greater bone mineral loss among the breast-feeding women? Use descriptive statistics, plots and/or tables to justify your conclusion.**

```{r}
## ---- Question-4 ------------------------------------------------------------

boneloss <- read.csv("https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/raw/master/data/boneloss.csv")

B_feeding <- subset(boneloss, type == "Breast-feeding")
O_feeding <- subset(boneloss, type == "Other")
```

Here are the summary statistics for the mineral loss in breast feeding participants:
```{r}
summary(B_feeding)
```

Here are the summary statistics for the mineral loss in non-breast feeding participants:
```{r}
summary(O_feeding)
```

```{r}
ggplot(boneloss, aes(x = type, y = mineral_loss, fill = type)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(caption = "Figure 3. Boxplots of mineral content compared between breastfeeding women and non-breastfeeding women. Mineral content was measured in percent change from the spines of participants over a 3 month period.", y = "Mineral Loss", x = "Feeding Type") + 
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "grey91")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","green")) + 
  ggtitle("Mineral Content Comparison Between Breastfeeding Women and Non-Breastfeeing Women")
```

First, by looking at the summary statistics between feeding types, it appears that there could be a substantial difference between the two feeding types. More specifically, the median value of -3.8 in the breastfeeding group is not even comparable to the median value  of -0.5 in the non-breastfeeding group, highlighting a potential difference between groups. Upon visual inspection, it can be seen that there is no overlap between the boxes of the green and blue box plots, which provides more evidence that there could be a meaningful difference between feeding types. The next step would be to perform statistics tests to determine if there is a significant difference between feeding types. 

# Food in America

**Pick your best and least favorite graphic, and briefly explain why using the taxonomy we learned in class and provide a link to the figure.**

My least favourite figure is [Figure 1](https://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america#list-2). My biggest critique has to do with the choice of colours and drawings. The drawings used to represent principal product from that specific area is not entirely intuitive and could have used a specific colour to distinguish different principal products. Perhaps it may have been more intuitive in 1922, but colour scheme with a corresponding legend would have been more effective way to convey principal product to readers.

My favourite figure is [Figure 15](https://www.vox.com/a/explain-food-america#list-20). The colour scheme is used in an effective way to convey meat consumption in the world. The colour is used to convey degree of meat consumption, with darker red corresponding higher meat consumption in the country. The outline for the countries is delineated well so the reader can compare the degree of red between neighbouring countries.
