|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|`qnorm(p = c(0.05, 0.95))` |`r qnorm(p = c(0.05, 0.95))`    |

# Descriptive Statistics 

## True or false, and explain briefly.

a. If you add 7 to each value on a list, you add 7 to the SD.
b. If you double each value on a list, you double the SD.
c. If you change the sign of each value on a list, you change the sign of the SD.
d. If you duplicate each value in a list, you leave the SD approximately unchanged.
e. If all the values in a list are positive, you cannot have a SD which is larger than the mean.
f. Half the values on a list are always below the mean.
g. In a large list, the distribution of measurements follows the normal curve quite closely.
h. If two large populations have exactly the same average value of 50 and the same SD of 10, then the percentage of values between 40 and 60 must be exactly the same for both populations.
i. The variance of the sum of two random variables is always bigger than the variance of each one.
j. An researcher has a computer file of pre-treatment WBCs for patients. They range from 2,800 to 38,600. By accident, the highest WBC gets changed to 386,000. This affects the mean but not the median and the IQR.
k. For the men in a large U.S. sample survey (the HANES study), mean income in the different age groups increased with age until 50 or so and then gradually declined. Thus, the income of a typical man increases as he ages until 50 or so and then starts decreasing.
l. Suppose all students in a class of 20 got the same wrong answer to a multiple choice exam question with 4 choices. To test whether the students colluded [ont triché] while the monitor was out of the room for 2 minutes, the school principal calculated the probability that a random variable $Y$ with a Binomial(20,0.25) distribution would be $\geq 20$. He did this by first calculating $\mu=20 \times .25 = 5$ and $SD=\sqrt{(0.25 \times 0.75)/ 20}$. He then calculated $P\left(Z \geq \frac{20-\mu}{SD}\right)$ and, finding that the P-value was very small, he concluded that the students had "almost certainly" colluded. List two problems (1) with the main calculation error and (2) an even bigger logical error in inference; ignore the issue of continuity corrections and the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation. 


## A overview of randomized clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis [BMJ on 22 Jan. 1994] found the following:

|Category of trial | \% odds reduction (SD) |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| General surgery | 37% ( 8) |
| Traumatic orthopaedic surgery | 31% (13) |
| elective orthopaedic surgery | 49% (11) |


a. Is 37% a statistic or a parameter? Why?
b. Does each SD refer to (i) variation of individuals or (ii) sampling variation associated with the
estimate? Explain your reasoning.



## As part of a survey, a large company asked 1000 of its employees how far they commute to work each day (round trip). The average round trip commute distance was 18 Km, with an SD of 25 Km. 

a. Would a rough sketch of the histogram for the data look more like (a) or (b) or (c)? Or is there a mistake somewhere? Explain your answer.

\end{figure}

<!--Since can only have non-negative values, and SD is larger than mean, must have long right tail as in (c).-->


## In a study of the effects of acid rain, a random sample of 100 trees from a particular forest are examined. Forty percent of these show some signs of damage. Which of the following statements are correct?

a. 40% is a parameter
b. 40% is a statistic
c. 40% of all trees in this forest show signs of damage
d. more than 40% of the trees in this forest show some signs of damage 
e. less than 40% of the trees in this forest show some signs of damage

## (10 points) Figure \ref{fig:fig1} below is a histogram of blood pressure in millimetres of mercury (mm) for all 14,148 women in the Contraceptive Drug Study at the Kaiser Clinic in Walnut Creek, California. Use the histogram to answer the following questions:

a. Is the percentage of women with blood pressures above 130 mm around 25%, 50% or, 75%?
b. Is the percentage of women with blood pressures between 90 mm and 160 mm around 1%, 50%, or 99%?
c. In which interval are there more women: 135-140 mm or 140-150 mm?
d. Which interval is more crowded: 135-140 mm or 140-150 mm?
e. In the interval 125-130 mm, the height of the histogram is about 2.1% per mm. What percentage of the women had blood pressures in this class interval?
f. Which interval has more women: 97-98 mm or 102-103 mm?
g. Where is the most crowded millimeter of all?

## (10 points) One term, about 700 students enrolled in the "Statistics 2" course at the University of California were asked how many college math courses they had taken, other than the "Statistics 2" course. The average number of courses was about 1.1; the SD was about 1.5. Would the histogram for the data look like (i), (ii), or (iii)? Explain.

## (5 points) Breast-feeding mothers secrete calcium into their milk. Some of the calcium may come from their bones, so mothers may lose bone mineral content. Researchers compared 47 breast-feeding women with 22 women of similar age who were neither pregnant nor lactating. They measured the percent change in the mineral content of the women's spines over three months. A negative value of `mineral_loss` indicates a loss in mineral content. Consider this box plot of the mineral loss by group:

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.dim=c(6, 4)}
boneloss <- read.csv("https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/EPIB607/raw/master/data/boneloss.csv")
library(mosaic)
ggformula::gf_boxplot(mineral_loss ~ type, data = boneloss) + theme_linedraw() + gg_sy + xlab("group") + ylab("mineral loss")
# mosaic::IQR(mineral_loss ~ type, data = boneloss)
```

a. The interquartile range for the breast-feeding group is approximately (select one answer from the following options):
    - [-2, -5.3]
    - 3.2
    - [-8, 2]
    - 10
b. The median mineral loss for the other group is (select one answer from the following options):
    - approximately equal to the mean
    - less than the mean
    - greater than the mean
    - there is not enough information in the plot to know


## (5 points) A sample was taken of the salaries of 20 employees of a large company. The following are the salaries (in thousands of dollars) for this year. For convenience, the data are ordered. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, opts.label="kill_prefix"}
c(28,31,34,35,37,41,42,42,42,47,47,51,52,52,60,61,67,72,75,80)
```

a. Suppose each employee in the company receives a \$3,000 raise for next year (each employee's salary is increased by \$3,000). The standard deviation of the salaries for the employees will (select one from the following list of options):
    - be unchanged
    - increase by \$3,0000
    - be multiplied by \$3,000
    - increase by $\sqrt{\$3,000}$
b. Suppose each employee in the company receives a 4% reaise for the next year. The standard deviation of the salaries for the employees will (select one from the following list of options):
    - be unchaged
    - increase by 16%
    - increase by 4%
    - increase by 2%


## (10 points) Stephen Jay Gould's book "The Mismeasure of Man" discusses a table from a 1978 article by Epstein. Gould read the original article and found that Epstein's original table, reproduced below, reveals that the \textit{SE} column had been copied and re-labelled \textit{SD}. Then, using this SD, and the $n$, Epstein was able to show that the CI's for mean head circumference for people of varied vocational statuses did not overlap, and thus that there were "statistically significant" inter-group differences.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrcc}
\hline
\normalsize Vocational Status & \normalsize  N & \normalsize  Mean (in mm) &\normalsize  SD \\
\hline
\normalsize Professional  &\normalsize  25 &\normalsize  569.9 &\normalsize  1.9 \\
\normalsize Semiprofessional & \normalsize 61& \normalsize 566.5 & \normalsize 1.5 \\
\normalsize Clerical &\normalsize 107 &\normalsize 566.2 & \normalsize 1.1 \\
\normalsize Trades &\normalsize 194 & \normalsize 565.7 &\normalsize  0.8 \\
\normalsize Public service & \normalsize 25 & \normalsize 564.1 & \normalsize 2.5 \\
\normalsize Skilled trades & \normalsize 351 & \normalsize 562.9 & \normalsize 0.6 \\
\normalsize Personal services & \normalsize 262 & \normalsize 562.7 & \normalsize 0.7 \\
\normalsize Laborers & \normalsize 647 & \normalsize 560.7 & \normalsize 0.3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Head circumferences in mm for people of varied vocational statuses}
\end{table}

a. How did Gould figure out that Epstien relabelled the SE column to SD?
b. Based on the table, what would be a reasonable SD for inter-individual headsizes?


# Confidence Intervals, P-values

## (5 points) One term at McGill University, 400 students took the final in the "Advanced Statistics" course. Their scores averaged 65.3 out of 100, and the SD was 25. You are given that $\sqrt{400} \times 25=500$ and $500/400=1.25$. Is  `qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975), mean = 65.3, sd = 1.25)` a 95% confidence interval? If so, for what? If not, why not?


## (5 points) Many journal editors and referees are suggesting that a confidence interval (CI) is often a useful adjunct (or even a replacement for) a statistical test of significance. Suppose that we use a $t$-test to decide whether two sample means are significantly different. 

a. If the means ARE significantly different from each other, what more can the CI tell us? 
b. If the means ARE NOT significantly different from each other, what more can the CI tell us? 

## A health department serves 50,000 households. As part of a survey, a simple random sample of 400 of these households are surveyed. The average number of adults in the sample households is 2.35, and the SD is 1.1. 

a. Sketch a possible frequency distribution showing the variability in the number of adults per household
b. If possible, find an approximate 95%-confidence interval for the average number of adults in all 50,000 households, and from it an approximate 95%-confidence interval for the total number of adults in all 50,000 households. If this isn't possible, explain why not.
c. All adults in the 400 sample households are interviewed. This makes 940 people. On the average, the sample people watched 4.2 hours of television the Sunday before the survey, and the SD was 2.1 hours. If possible, find an approximate 95%-confidence interval for the average number of hours spent watching television by all adults in the 50,000 households on that Sunday. If this isn't possible, explain why not.



## New laser altimeters can measure elevation to within a few inches, without bias, and with no trend or pattern to the measurements. As part of an experiment, 25 readings were made on the elevation of a mountain peak. Their mean was 81,411 inches, and their SD was 30 inches. Fill in the blanks in part (a), then say whether each of (b-e) is true or false; explain your answers briefly. (You may assume Gaussian variation of the measurements, with no bias.)

a. The elevation of the mountain peak is estimated as __________ . There is approximately a ______ %
chance that we are over-estimating or under-estimating the true elevation by more than 6 inches.
b. 81,411 $\pm$ 12 inches is a 95%-confidence interval for the average of the 25 readings.
c. 81,411 $\pm$ 12 inches is a 95%-confidence interval for the elevation of the mountain peak.
d. A large majority of the 25 readings were in the range 81,411 $\pm$ 12 inches.
e. The elevation of the mountain peak is the statistic here; the 81,411 is a parameter.



## A significance test gives a P-value of .04. From this we can... [indicate True/False for each]

a. reject $H_0$ at the $\alpha$ = .01 level
b. reject $H_0$ at the $\alpha$ = .05 level
c. say that the probability that H0 is false is .04. 
d. say that the probability that H0 is true is .04. 



## In a simple random sample (n=225) of all institutions of higher learning in the U.S., the average enrollment was 3,700, with an SD of 6,000. A histogram for the enrollments was plotted and did not follow the normal curve. However, the average enrollment at all institutions in the U.S. was estimated to be around 3,700 (SE = 400). Say whether each of the following statements are true or false, and explain why.

a. It is estimated that 95% of the institutions of higher learning in the U.S. enroll between 3,700-800 = 2,900 and 3,700 + 800 = 4,500 students.
b. An approximate 95%-confidence interval for the average enrollment of all institutions runs from 2,900 to 4,500.
c. If someone takes a simple random sample of 225 institutions and goes two SEs either way from the average enrollment of the 225 sample schools, there is about a 95% chance that this interval will cover the average enrollment of all schools.


## You have measured the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of a random sample of 25 employees of a company. A 95% confidence interval for the mean systolic blood pressure for the employees of this company is (122, 138). Which of the following statements gives a valid interpretation of this interval?

a. 95% of the sample of employees have a systolic blood pressure between 122 and 138.
b. 95% of the population of employees have a SBP between 122 and 138.
c. If the procedure were repeated many times, 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the population mean SBP
d. The probability that the population mean SBP is between 122 and 138 is 0.95.
e. If the procedure were repeated many times, 95% of the sample means would be between 122 and 138.


## A 95% confidence interval for the mean reading score for a population of third grade students is (44.2, 54.2). Suppose you compute a 99% confidence interval. Which of the following statements is correct?

a. both intervals have the same width
b. the 99% interval is wider
c. the 95% interval is wider
d. you cannot determine which interval is wider unless you know $n$ and $s$


## You are reading an article in your field. The article says that the P-value for a significance test is 0.045. Is this result significant at the 5% significance level?


## You want to compute a 90% confidence interval for the mean of a population with unknown population standard deviation. The sample size is 30. Give the `R` code of the critical value you would use for this interval

## True or False ? A 90% confidence interval will have a larger margin of error than a 95% confidence interval using the same data.

## True or False ? In a test of significance, a P-value of 0.03 means that there is only probability 0.03 that the null hypothesis is true.

## True or False ? The margin of error in a confidence interval does not take into account errors from such sources as failing to contact subjects or incorrect responses due to the subject's bad memory.



# One-sample proportion
    
## (5 points) Suppose that the probability that HIV will be passed from an infected person to an infected person during a single sexual conact is 0.01. Suppose that you observe a random selection of 50 such contacts. Write the `R` code needed to answer the following questions:

a. The probability that HIV will be passed on in at least one of the 50 contacts.
b. The probability that HIV will not be passed in 25 contacts.
c. The probabiility that HIV will be passed in no more than 25 contacts.


## (10 points) To allow for the 10% (on average) of people who make reservations but do not show up for their flights, an airline company "over-books", i.e., it takes reservations for up to 145 seats when it only has space on the plane for 140 passengers. 

a. If the airline takes 145 reservations, what is the probability that it will not have a seat for every passenger who shows up? State your assumptions and provide the `R` code to calculate this probability.
b. Would the normal distribution be appropriate here? Why or why not?
c. Suppose that some of the 145 individuals are related. Does this affect the appropriateness of the probability model you base your calculations on? Why or why not?


## (4 points) An airplane has a front and a rear door which are both opened to allow passengers to exit when the plane lands. The plane has 100 passengers seated. The number of passengers exiting through the front door should have (select one of the following options and \textbf{justify your choice}):

a. a binomial distribution with mean 50.
b. a binomial distribution with 100 trials but success probability not equal to 0.5.
c. a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 5.
d. none of the above.

## In which of the following would X not have a Binomial distribution? Why?

a. $Y$ = number of women in different random samples of size 20 from the 1990 directory of statisticians.
b. $Y$ = number of occasions, out of a randomly selected sample of 100 occasions during the year, in which you were indoors. (One might use this design to estimate what proportion of time you spend indoors) <!--Fits definition of Binomial. Even though probability varies with season, random sampling introduces independence and equality of probabilities of a positive response, from sampled occasion to occasion. -->
c. $Y$ = number of months of the year in which it snows in Berlin.



## "We studied the involvement of naturally occurring odours in guiding the baby to the nipple. One breast of each participating mother was washed immediately after delivery. The newborn infant was placed prone between the breasts. Of 30 infants, 22 spontaneously selected the unwashed breast. The washing procedure had no effect on breast temperature. We concluded that the infants responded to olfactory differences between the washed and unwashed breasts". Abstract from "Does the newborn baby find the nipple by smell?" Varendo H et al., Lancet 1994 344: 989- 90.

a. What is the parameter at issue here?
b. State the implied null and alternative hypotheses concerning this parameter. 
c. What is the statistic reported? 
d. What 'reference distribution' should be used to test the hypothesis?
e. Given the sample size involved, how would you calculate the p-value using `R`? 


# Sample size 

## (8 points) Suppose we want a 95% confidence interval for the average amount spent on books by students in their first year at university. The interval is to have a margin of error of $5.

a. If the 'best estimate' is that the amounts spent have a standard deviation $s =\$50$, then the number of observations required (in a simple random sample) is closest to (select one from the following options):
    - 196
    - 250
    - 400
    - 475
b. The amounts spent by individuals are unlikely to have a normal distribution. Is this critical to your calculations? Explain. 


# One-sample mean 

## (8 points) The nicotine content in cigarettes of a certain brand is normally distributed with mean (in milligrams) $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 0.1$. The brand advertises that the mean nicotine content of its cigarettes is 1.5, but measurements on a random sample of 100 cigarettes of this brand gave a mean $\bar{x}=1.53$. Is this evidence that the mean nicotine content is actually higher than advertised? State the null and alternative hypotheses, your assumptions and a statement discussing the results of your analysis. 


## (8 points) The US presidential campaign is now gathering pace, with all the customary razzmatazz. Much time and trouble could be saved, however, if the candidates simply had their height measured: with one exception, the President has always been the taller candidate. Tall people are credited with qualities expected of capable people. 

Consider the second and third sentences in the first paragraph

a. State the null hypothesis against which you can statistically test the claim.
b. There are a few ways to test this; what test statistic you would use?
c. What reference distribution will your use to describe the sampling variation of the test statistic under the null hypothesis? 

(Third sentence) The number of elections on which the data are based is not given, but say for the sake of this exercise that it is 50. 

d. Carry out the statistical test and provide a statement regarding your findings. 


## (10 points) A colony of laboratory mice consisted of several hundred animals. Their average weight was 30g, with a standard deviation of 5g. As part of an experiment, graduate students were instructed to choose 25 animals; no definite method of selection was specified in the instructions to the students. The average weight of the 25 animals selected by the students was 33 grams. 

a. Was the method of choosing animals used by the graduate student equivalent to drawing animals at random? Discuss briefly, carefully formulating the hypotheses and performing a test of significance with a Type I error rate of 5%.
b. Provide the `R` code needed to calculate a 99% confidence interval for the true mean weight in the population generated by the selection method used by the student.
c. What sample size would be required to obtain a 95% confidence interval of width 2g?


## The diameter of red blood cells in healthy adults has a Gaussian distribution with mean 7.5 microns and standard deviation 0.3 microns. 

a. Approximately what fraction of red blood cells have a diameter between 7.1 and 7.6 microns? 
b. Would the standard deviation of red blood cells be about the same in a bigger person (with more red blood cells) as in a smaller person (with fewer red cells)? Why/why not? What general lesson does this example give about the relation between the SD of individual observations and the number of observations?

<!--
7.1 ==> z = (7.1–7.5)/0.3 = –1.33; 7.6 ==> z = (7.6-7.5)/0.3 = 0.33; Pr(7.1 - 7.6) = 0.6293–0.0918 = 0.5375
-->

## A significance test was performed to test the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 2$ versus the alternative $H_a: \mu \neq 2$. The test statistic is z = 1.40. The P-value for this test is approximately

a. 0.16 
b. 0.08
c. 0.003
d. 0.92
e. 0.70



# Power for one-sample mean

## (10 points) You are aware that students writing statistics exams have enough to worry about without their calculators failing, so you try to develop a calculator battery that lasts longer than typical batteries. The lifetime of typical batteries is Normally distributed with mean 180.2 minutes, with a known standard deviation of 8.3 minutes. Your new battery also appears to have a lifetime that is Normally distributed with a standard deviation of 8.3 minutes. You want to test whether the new battery is significantly better, and opt for the more conservative, two-sided test with a Type I error rate of 0.01. Using a sample of size 14, you find that your batteries last 186.1 minutes on average. (If you need the $z$ or $t$ probabilities/quantiles, provide the corresponding `R` code needed for that calculation).

a. Is there evidence that your new batteries are different from the old batteries? State your hypothesis, provide a confidence interval and a p-value, and summarize your results.  
b. Assume your answer in part (a) results in a p-value of 0.008. Explain what this p-value means.
c. Find the power of a 1% significance test against the alternative $\mu = 190$ minutes. 
d. At a 1% level of significance, find the probability of a Type II error when the alternative is $\mu = 182$.
e. What sample size is required to detect a difference of 3 minutes at a 1% level of significance with 90% power?


# Bootstrap


## (10 points) Verizon was an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC), responsible for maintaining land-line phone service in certain areas. Verizon also sold long-distance service, as did a number of competitors, termed Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC). When something went wrong, Verizon was responsible for repairs, and was supposed to make repairs as quickly for CLEC long-distance customers as for their own. The New York Public Utilities Commission monitored fairness by comparing repair times for Verizon and different CLECs, for different classes of repairs and time periods. The results (in minutes) for a specific class of repairs is shown in the Table \ref{tab:tab2}. You decide to independently draw 10,000 bootstrap samples with replacement from each sample (ILEC and CLEC), and compute the mean repair time (in minutes) for each bootstrap sample. You then calculate the bootstrap standard deviation from the 10,000 bootstrap samples, separately for ILEC and CLEC.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrcc}
\hline
\normalsize Carrier  &\normalsize  n  &\normalsize  mean &\normalsize  SD\\
\hline
\normalsize ILEC  &\normalsize  1664 &\normalsize  8.41 &\normalsize  16.5\\
\normalsize CLEC  &\normalsize  23 &\normalsize  16.69 &\normalsize  19.5\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Repair times (in minutes)}\label{tab:tab2}
\end{table}



a. Would the bootstrap SD for ILEC be larger, smaller or approximately similar to the SD presented in \mbox{Table \ref{tab:tab2}} for ILEC? Explain
b. Would the bootstrap SD for CLEC be larger, smaller or approximately similar to the SD presented in \mbox{Table \ref{tab:tab2}} for CLEC? Explain
c. Would the bootstrap SD for ILEC be larger, smaller or approximately similar to the bootstrap SD for CLEC? Explain
d. Do you expect the bootstrap to give a very different 95% confidence interval (for either carrier) compared to the one obtained by the $z$ procedure? Why or why not?


































<!--
2. The bootstrap distribution is centered at the observed statistic,
not the population parameter, for example, at x, not .
This has two profound implications. First, it means that we do
not use the mean of the bootstrap statistics as a replacement for
the original estimate.1 For example, we cannot use the bootstrap
to improve on x; no matter how many bootstrap samples we take, they are centered at x, not . Instead we use the bootstrap
to tell how accurate the original estimate is. In this regard the
bootstrap is like formula methods that use the data twice—once
to compute an estimate, and again to compute a standard error
for the estimate. The bootstrap just uses a different approach to
estimating the standard error.

<!--Not a confidence interval. For one thing, we don't know what chance process it uses. This is a sample of convenience not a simple random sample.-->

<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
