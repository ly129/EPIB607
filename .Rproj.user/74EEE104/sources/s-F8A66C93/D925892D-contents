briefly.}\label{true-or-false-and-explain-briefly.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If you add 7 to each value on a list, you add 7 to the SD.
\item
  If you double each value on a list, you double the SD.
\item
  If you change the sign of each value on a list, you change the sign of
  the SD.
\item
  If you duplicate each value in a list, you leave the SD approximately
  unchanged.
\item
  If all the values in a list are positive, you cannot have a SD which
  is larger than the mean.
\item
  Half the values on a list are always below the mean.
\item
  In a large list, the distribution of measurements follows the normal
  curve quite closely.
\item
  If two large populations have exactly the same average value of 50 and
  the same SD of 10, then the percentage of values between 40 and 60
  must be exactly the same for both populations.
\item
  The variance of the sum of two random variables is always bigger than
  the variance of each one.
\item
  An researcher has a computer file of pre-treatment WBCs for patients.
  They range from 2,800 to 38,600. By accident, the highest WBC gets
  changed to 386,000. This affects the mean but not the median and the
  IQR.
\item
  For the men in a large U.S. sample survey (the HANES study), mean
  income in the different age groups increased with age until 50 or so
  and then gradually declined. Thus, the income of a typical man
  increases as he ages until 50 or so and then starts decreasing.
\item
  Suppose all students in a class of 20 got the same wrong answer to a
  multiple choice exam question with 4 choices. To test whether the
  students colluded {[}ont trich√©{]} while the monitor was out of the
  room for 2 minutes, the school principal calculated the probability
  that a random variable \(Y\) with a Binomial(20,0.25) distribution
  would be \(\geq 20\). He did this by first calculating
  \(\mu=20 \times .25 = 5\) and \(SD=\sqrt{(0.25 \times 0.75)/ 20}\). He
  then calculated \(P\left(Z \geq \frac{20-\mu}{SD}\right)\) and,
  finding that the P-value was very small, he concluded that the
  students had ``almost certainly'' colluded. List two problems (1) with
  the main calculation error and (2) an even bigger logical error in
  inference; ignore the issue of continuity corrections and the accuracy
  of the Gaussian approximation.

  Would the bootstrap SD for ILEC be larger, smaller or approximately
  similar to the SD presented in \mbox{Table \ref{tab:tab2}} for ILEC?
  Explain
\item
  Would the bootstrap SD for CLEC be larger, smaller or approximately
  similar to the SD presented in \mbox{Table \ref{tab:tab2}} for CLEC?

\item
  Would the bootstrap SD for ILEC be larger, smaller or approximately
  similar to the bootstrap SD for CLEC? Explain
\item
  Do you expect the bootstrap to give a very different 95\% confidence
  interval (for either carrier) compared to the one obtained by the
  \(z\) procedure? Why or why not?
