# Binomial Distribution 1

In which of the following would Y not have a Binomial distribution? Provide your justification in the rationale.

a. Y = Number, out of 60 occupants of 30 randomly chosen cars, wearing seatbelts.
b. Y = Number, out of 60 occupants of 60 randomly chosen cars, wearing seatbelts.
C. Y = Number, out of simple random sample of 100 individuals, that are left-handed.

# Binomial Distribution 2
In which of the following would Y not have a Binomial distribution? Provide your justification in the rationale.

a. You want to know what percent of married people believe that mothers of young children should not be employed outside the home. You plan to interview 50 people, and for the sake of convenience you decide to interview both the husband and the wife in 25 married couples. The random variable Y is the number among the 50 persons interviewed who think mothers should not be employed.
b. You observe the sex of the next 50 children born at a local hospital; Y is the number of girls among them.
c. Y = number of occasions, out of a randomly selected sample of 100 occasions during the year, in which you were indoors.

# Binomial Distribution 3

The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics reports that approximately 12% of emergency department visits result in hospital admissions. Consider 20 randomly selected emergency department visits and assume that visits to emergency departments are independent. What is the approximate probability that at most 2 of the 20 visits would result in hospital admissions?


a. **0.5631 (Correct)**
b. 0.2740
c. 0.1344
d. 0.2891
r. 0.4369

# Binomial DIstribution 4
The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics reports that approximately 12% of emergency department visits result in hospital admissions. Consider 20 randomly selected emergency department visits and assume that visits to emergency departments are independent. How many hospital admissions do we expect, on average, in a random sample of 20 emergency department visits?


a. 2
b. **2.4 (Correct)**
c. 12
d. 24
e. 1.4533

# Binomial Distribution 5

The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics reports that approximately 12% of emergency department visits result in hospital admissions. Consider 20 randomly selected emergency department visits and assume that visits to emergency departments are independent. If Y is the number of emergency department visits that result in hospital admissions in random samples of 20 visits, what is approximately the standard deviation of Y?


a. **1.45 (Correct)**
b. 2.11
c. 4.46

# Binomial Distribution 6

According to the 2015 U.S. census update, approximately 13% of Americans are black. Let Y be the number of blacks in a random sample of 1500 Americans. What is the probability that the sample will contain 200 or more blacks?


a. pbinom(q = 200, size = 1500, prob = 0.13)
b. 1-dbinom(x = 200, size = 1500, prob = 0.13)
c. dbinom(x = 200, size = 1500, prob = 0.13)
d. \textttt{pnorm(200, mean = 195, sd = 13.025, lower.tail = FALSE)} **(Correct)**
e. \texttt{1 - pbinom(q = 200, size = 1500, prob = 0.13, lower.tail = FALSE)} **(Correct)**

# One Sample Proportion 1

A CDC report on secondhand smoke at home gives the following 95% confidence interval for the percent of California households that are free of secondhand smoke: (90.8, 92.2). The correct interpretation for this confidence interval is that we can be 95% confident that

a. the proportion of households free of secondhand smoke in another sample of California households would be between 0.908 and 0.922
b. the population mean number of households in California that are free of secondhand smoke is between 90.8 and 92.2
c. **the true proportion of all California households that are free of secondhand smoke is between 0.908 and 0.922 (Correct)**

# One Sample Proportion 2

A CDC report on secondhand smoke at home gives the following 95% confidence interval for the percent of California households that are free of secondhand smoke: (90.8, 92.2). What is the margin of error for this interval?

a. **0.007 (Correct)**
b. 0.014
