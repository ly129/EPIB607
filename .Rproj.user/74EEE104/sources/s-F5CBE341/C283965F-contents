# Which R function would we use to answer the following question: what is the probability of seeing an IQ score as extreme as 130 (select all that apply)?

1. pnorm **(Correct)**
2. qnorm
3. dnorm
4. rnorm


# Which R function would we use to answer the following question: What is the 75th percentile of the IQ scores distribution (select all that apply)?

1. pnorm 
2. qnorm **(Correct)**
3. dnorm
4. rnorm

# The population SD is unknown and is denoted by $\sigma$. In an SRS of size $n$, the standard deviation of that sample is 

1. the sample standard deviation **(Correct)**
2. the sample standard deviation divided by $\sqrt{n}$
3. $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$


# The sampling distribution of $\bar{y}$ (select all that apply):

1. describes how the statistic $\bar{y}$ varies in all possible SRSs of the same size from the same population **(Correct)**
2. is Normally distributed
3. is Normally distributed only if the population distribution is Normal
4. is usually unknown **(Correct)**
5. is centered around the population mean $\mu$ **(Correct)**
6. has an SD greater than the population SD for an SRS of size $n$

# The central limit theorem applies to one random sample

1. TRUE
2. FALSE **(Correct)**


# A 95% confidence interval for the mean $\mu$  (select all that apply)

1. is a random quantity **(Correct)**
2. tells us that in the long run, 95%  of your intervals will contain the mean $\mu$ **(Correct)**
3. tells us that in the long run, 95%  of your intervals will contain the sample mean $\bar{y}$


# Which of the following assumptions are needed to be able to use a formula of the form $\bar{y} \pm  z^\star (\sigma / \sqrt{n})$ (select all that apply)

1. the population distribution must be normal
2. the CLT has 'kicked in' **(Correct)**
3. we have an SRS of size $n$ from the population of interest **(Correct)**

# A 95% CI for the mean $\mu$ is given by $\bar{y} \pm  z^\star (\sigma / \sqrt{n})$. This can be calculated in R using the following command (select all that apply)

1. $\bar{y}$ + qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975)) $(\sigma / \sqrt{n})$ **(Correct)**
2. $\bar{y}$ + qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975), mean = $\bar{y}$, sd = $\sigma$) $(\sigma / \sqrt{n})$
3. $\bar{y}$ + qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975), mean = $\bar{y}$, sd = $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$)
4. $\bar{y}$ + qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975), mean = 0, sd = $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$)
5. qnorm(p = c(0.025, 0.975), mean = $\bar{y}$, sd = $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$) **(Correct)**

<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
