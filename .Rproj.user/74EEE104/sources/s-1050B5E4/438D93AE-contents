# Marking {-}

Completion of this DALITE exercise will be availble to us automatically through the DALITE website. Therefore **you do not need to hand anything in**. Marks will be based on the number of correct answers. For each question you will receive 0.5 marks for getting the correct answer on the first attempt and an additional 0.5 marks if you stick with the right answer or switch to the correct answer after seeing someone else's rationale. Recall that access to your assignments is managed through tokens sent to your e-mail address. You will be sent a new link everytime a new assignment has been posted.


# Parameters and statistics

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the difference between a parameter and a statistic.
2. A parameter is related to the population.
3. A statistic is related to the sample.

## Required Readings

1. [JH section 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kr293cablb11nrm/Ch13SamplingDistributionsJH2018.pdf?dl=0)
2. [B&M page 314](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8u0j9lupv5pxqpm/Ch13SamplingDistributions.pdf?dl=0)

# Sampling Distributions 

## Learning Objectives

1. Recognize that there is variability due to sampling. Repeated random samples from the same population will give variable results.
2. Understand the concept of a sampling distribution of a statistic such as a sample mean, sample median, or sample proportion.
3. Know that the sampling distributions of some common statistics are approximately normally distributed; in particular, the sample mean x of a simple random sample drawn from a normal population has a normal distribution.
4. Know that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x depends on both the standard deviation of the population from which the sample was drawn and the sample size $n$.
5. Grasp a key concept of statistical process control: Monitor the process rather than examine
all of the products; all processes have variation; we want to distinguish the natural variation of
the process from the added variation that shows that the process has been disturbed.
6. Make an $\bar{x}$ control chart. Use the 68-95-99.7% rule and the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ to
help identify if a process is out of control.

# Central Limit Theorem

## Learning Objectives

1. Be familiar with the Central Limit Theorem: the sample mean $\bar{x}$ of a large number of
observations has an approximately normal distribution even when the distribution of individual
observations is not normal.

## Required Readings  

1. [B\&M pages 321-324](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8u0j9lupv5pxqpm/Ch13SamplingDistributions.pdf?dl=0)  



<!-- 
We support several options via the YAML header

- Setting a DOI or URL footer, for example for the CRAN package URL,
  which is placed in the bottom-left footer of the title page and even pages;
- Setting a footer label, for example _YourPackage Vignette_ stating
  your package, which is placed in the bottom-right footer on odd
  pages;
- Setting a free-form author field used on the inside footer;
- Optional _Draft_ watermarking;



## References 

Here we differ from PNAS and suggest natbib. References will appear in
author-year form. Use `\citet{}`, `\citep{}`, etc as usual.

We default to the `jss.bst` style. To switch to a different bibliography
style, please use `biblio-style: style` in the YAML header.


## Inline R Code 

The PNAS sample included a fixed PNG image here, but this document prefers
to show the results and embedding of _R_ code. 

```{r figex, fig.width=3, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Narrow ggplot2 figure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
    geom_point(size=3, aes(colour=factor(cyl))) +
    theme(legend.position="none")
```

Here we use a standard knitr bloc with explicit options for

- figure width and height (`fig.width`, `fig.height`), both set to three inches;
- whether the code is shown (`echo=TRUE`); and
- the caption (`fig.cap`) as shown above.


## Digital Figures 

Markdown, Pandoc and LaTeX support `.eps` and `.pdf` files.

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way
using the `\label{}` and `\ref{}` commands.

The R examples above show how to insert a column-wide
figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment. 

One (roundabout) way of doing this is to _not_ actually plot a figure, but to
save it in a file as the following segment shows:

```{r densityPlot, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data = midwest,
            mapping = aes(x = area,
                          fill = state,
                          color = state)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
## save to file
suppressMessages(ggsave("densities.pdf", p))
```

This file is then included via standard LaTeX commands.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth, height=3.5in]{densities} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Wide ggplot2 figure}\label{fig}
\end{figure*}


## Typeset Code (But Do Not Run It) 

We can also just show code.

```r
xx <- faithful[,"eruptions"]
fit <- density(xx)
plot(fit)
```

This simply used a pandoc bloc started and ended by three backticks,
with `r` as the language choice.  Similarly, _many_ other languages
can be typeset directly simply by relying on pandoc.


## Single column equations 

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to
their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, options are to use the
`\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}` environment mentioned above for
figures, or to use the `\begin{widetext}...\end{widetext}` environment
as shown in equation \ref{eqn:example} below.

Please note that this option may run into problems with floats and
footnotes, as mentioned in the [cuted package
documentation](http://texdoc.net/pkg/cuted). In the case of problems
with footnotes, it may be possible to correct the situation using
commands `\footnotemark` and `\footnotetext`.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
       \label{eqn:example} 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


pandoc writes all tables using longtable, which fails in 2-column mode
