## The Lady Tasting Tea

This example is adapted from _Start Teaching with R_ [@startwithR] and [JH notes unit 8_B](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/med2/unit8b_epi_nov21.pdf).  

There is a famous story about a lady who claimed that
tea with milk tasted different depending on whether the
milk was added to the tea or the tea added to the milk.
The story is famous because of the setting in which she
made this claim. She was attending a party in Cambridge,
England, in the 1920s. Also in attendance were a number
of university dons and their wives. The scientists in at-
tendance scoffed at the woman and her claim. What, after
all, could be the difference?
All the scientists but one, that is. Rather than simply
dismiss the womanâ€™s claim, he proposed that they decide
how one should test the claim. The tenor of the conversa-
tion changed at this suggestion, and the scientists began
to discuss how the claim should be tested. Within a few
minutes cups of tea with milk had been prepared and
presented to the woman for tasting.
At this point, you may be wondering who the innova-
tive scientist was and what the results of the experiment
were. The scientist was R. A. Fisher, who first described
