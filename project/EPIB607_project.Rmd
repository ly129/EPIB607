# Final Project


Construct an exercise and solutions suitable for testing or demonstrating understanding of basic principles of biostatistics as discussed in this course.

\vspace*{.3in}

Exercises must be based on (i) one to two articles in a scientific journal or perhaps in the lay press
or (ii) a \textit{publicly available} dataset. The data must not be taken from an RA project, but must be
freely available on the web or another public source. The article or data should concern some health
problem amenable to statistical investigation. The narrative of the exercise should be clear and concise.
The exercise should comprise 5-7 questions requiring altogether about one hour for completion. The
questions may cover any part of this course. You must also produce a separate set of model answers;
these should be equally short and to the point. 


\vspace*{.3in}





In assessing the quality of your exercise, we shall consider the extent to which the questions test
understanding of important biostatistical principles in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. Credit
will also be given for choice of subject and ingenuity in use of the available information. The exercise,
model answers, and a copy of any published report(s) or the data on which the exercise is based must
be handed in by the deadline indicated.

\vspace*{.3in}

Projects should be done in groups of 2 to 4 people.
Examples final projects prepared by students in previous years will be posted on MyCourses.
All projects must be uploaded to myCourses. Due date TBD.

\vspace*{.3in}

The upload should consist of at most two files: (1) one file containing the questions, solutions, and any
article(s) on which the questions are based, and (2) a data-set in text or CSV format, if appropriate.
